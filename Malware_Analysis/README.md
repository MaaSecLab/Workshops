# Malware Analysis Workshop - "Game of Threats"

## Description
This workshop looks at how modern malware works and what it targets. We study how it hides, how it gets around antivirus software, and how to stop it. We focus on real-world examples. You learn how malware finds weak spots, how attackers cover their tracks, and how to protect systems against these threats.
